## Who am I?

My name is Luke, I am a college grad with my bachelors in Computer Security and Science

My previous experience with coding and computers started back in high school.  
Since then I have gained knowledge and skills throughout college, working professionally, and especially by working on my own personal projects.

## My Projects

#### Self-Hosting

I host a small server running a Type 1 Hypervisor (ProxMox) as the Base OS  
Here I can create Virtual Environments to test, break, and then fix any app or service I made or am testing out.
A large part of what I work with is further virtualized in Docker Containers for ease and portability.

This space also gives me the opportunity to work with several different operating systems and architectures.

#### Code Projects

I am always tinkering with some kind of tool or program to help make things easier for myself and hopefully others.  
A good example of this could be my Auto-Sockets built for C
