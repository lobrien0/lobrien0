## Who am I?

My name is Luke, I am currently a 4th year College student studying Computer Security at UCCS.

My previous experience with coding and computers started back in Highschool.  
Since then I have gained knowledge and skills throughout college, but even more so working on my own personal projects.

## My Projects

I host a small server running ProxMox as the Base OS  
Here I can create Virtual Environments to test, break, and then fix any app or service I decided to check out.

This space also give me the opportunity to work with several different operating systems and even architectures.
